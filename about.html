                    <p>
                        I'm currently in upstate NY at Cornell, studying Computer Science with a minor in Comparative Literature.
                        However, I've spent most of my life in California and the Pacific Northwest.

                    <p>
                        My technical and career interests include programming language design, type systems, compilers, distributed problems involving scalability and consistency,
                        and working on products that help people. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, you can often find me listening to Sufjan or Mitski, brewing tea, playing Tetris, or reading.
